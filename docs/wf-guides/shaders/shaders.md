# Must Know Info
### Textures/Materials
#### Introduction
Warframe has 3 different texture “Generations” you may encounter. Gen1 was used when the game first released, Gen2 was a transition to PBR rendering, and Gen3 is the latest version that new releases are using. You may encounter all of these depending on what you extract. Keep in mind that there exists several variations of Gen3 used for static meshes which this guide will not cover.

**If you’re not familiar with these concepts, you may have trouble setting up textures:** 

- Image channels (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)
- Normal maps
- Tint maps, AKA ID maps
- sRGB/Linear color space
- Image editors (Photoshop/GIMP/Paint.net)
