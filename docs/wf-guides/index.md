# Introduction 

## Ripping models from Warframe
Ever since January 2021, when DE decided to change the way that models are stored on your computer, we are  unable to use Ninjaripper to extract models. 
Now when you try and rip models they come out as a flattened pancake, as you can see here:

Because of this, Puxtrill took up the helm and created a tool to extract the models propperly.   
Now we use the [Warframe-Exporter](https://github.com/Puxtril/Warframe-Exporter) created by Puxtrill, the process for this is detailed on the [Extractor](extractor/index.md) page.  


### Curated Models  
If you are only here for the models that are set up already you can head to the  [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/fIUQDQYZ#vRNqurxNdzELIboK214Kxg) archive.  
Details on how to use these models are on the [How to use Curated Models](faq.md) page.

### Model extraction and setup  
If your model is not in the MEGA archive, you will need to use the Extractor to get the models.
The [Extractor](extractor/index.md) page contains the information needed to get you started on finding and exporting the models.  
The [Model Setup](models/character-setup.md) page contains the information on how to set up models that you have exported.  
The [Shaders](shaders/index.md) page contains the information needed to get you started on learning how to set up shaders for the models.
