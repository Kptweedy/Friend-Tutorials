## Ripping models from Warframe

Ripping from Warframe has changed - the old method of ripping via Ninjaripper no longer works as of January 2021, when DE decided to change the way models are stored on your computer. Ninjaripper will now rip models as a flattened pancake.

### Curated Models
Curated models are being uploaded to the [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/fIUQDQYZ#vRNqurxNdzELIboK214Kxg) archive. Please check there before starting your journey through this guide, as your desired model may already be ripped. 
For Details on how to use these models are on the [Downloading and using Curated Models](model-usage.md) page.

### How to extract models
If your model is not in the curated share, you will need to use Puxtrilâ€™s Warframe Exporter to get models/textures.
This step is detailed on the [Extractor](extractor.md) page.

### Setting Models Up yourself
If you would rather set the models up yourself you can use the information on the [Setting up models](model-setup.md) page.
