## Ripping models from Warframe
Ever since January 2021, when DE decided to change the way that models are stored on your computer, we are  unable to use Ninjaripper to extract models. 
Now when you try and rip models they come out as a flattened pancake, as you can see here:

Because of this, Puxtrill took up the helm and created a tool to extract the models 
Now we use the Warframe-Exporter created by Puxtrill, the process for this is detailed on the [Extractor](extractor/index.md) page.  


### Curated Models
Curated models are being uploaded to the [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/fIUQDQYZ#vRNqurxNdzELIboK214Kxg) archive. Please check there before starting your journey through this guide, as your desired model may already be ripped. 
For Details on how to use these models are on the [Downloading and using Curated Models](model-usage.md) page.

### How to extract models
If your model is not in the curated share, you will need to use Puxtrilâ€™s Warframe Exporter to get models/textures.
This step is detailed on the [Extractor](extractor/index.md) page.

### Setting Models Up yourself
If you would rather set the models up yourself you can use the information on the [Setting up models](model-setup.md) page.
