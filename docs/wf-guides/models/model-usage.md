### Downloading the Models
- To download the models go to the [Prvfru](https://mega.nz/folder/DBwnUCKZ#7AgPI0dQoNMOZKqzHKADPw) archive on mega.
	*Warframe/Characters/Tenno is where you will find already set up warframes*
once the the .rar of the warframe you want to use has been downloaded you will then need to download the DetailTextures.rar file in the Warframe/Details directory [File Link.](https://mega.nz/folder/DBwnUCKZ#7AgPI0dQoNMOZKqzHKADPw/file/nRYmmBzA)

You then want to extract DetailTextures to their own folder.
Then the model you downloaded to their own folder. 
The file structure should look like this:
```
C:\"Path to any folder"\DetailTextures
C:\"Path to any folder"\Characters\Tenno\"model you downloaded.blend"
```

## Using the models
*You will want to make sure that your blender build is the most updated it can be to avoid any issues that may occur*

After you have opened up blender you will want to open the file from where you downloaded it. 

Once you open the file your blender should look something like this

2. When you click it, one of three things will happen
 1. The status bar at the bottom of the window will show an error saying it is missing `Normal Atlas.bmp` and `PBR Atlas.bmp`, this means that your Detailtextures folder could not be found.
 2. The status bar will show errors for more than just `Normal Atlas.bmp` and `PBR Atlas.bmp` 
 3. No errors will show up, this means you can move on to the [[#How to change properties]] Section.
	1. Clicking the bar will then bring up the info log telling you what textures you are missing, If you see more than just `Normal Atlas.bmp` and `PBR Atlas.bmp` you may be using an outdated blend or another persons.
